This package contains the whac-a-mole exercise and also the solution

Note: Resources (CSS and images) are both here and in src/main/resources
- Eclipse will use resources stored with the .java files
- IntelliJ looks for resources in a separate resource-hierarchy

To do the exercise:
- Do not look at the file: MoleButton.java
- Copy all files except MoleButton.java to a new package
- Write your own version of MoleButton.java

The final solution is in the MoleButton.java file
